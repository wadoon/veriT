   \brief API for signal handling functionality.

   \note This module provides an API to centralize the signal handling
   necessities from different components. Once initialized, through
   call to veriT_signal_init, client modules may register a signal
   handler procedure and an address. The signal handler procedure
   sig_handler shall have one argument P, a pointer.

   When the program is signaled, all registered signal handling
   procedures are called with the signal and the corresponding address
   as argument.

   Routine veriT_signal_done shall be called to free the resources
   allocated by the module. After it has been called, the program will
   no longer react to signals with the registered signal handlers.
