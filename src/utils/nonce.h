/**
   \brief Provides an API to generate different names with a given prefix.

   \note Usage protocol:

   MAIN(n, prefix) = nonce_init(n, prefix) -> RUN(n)
   RUN(n) = (nonce_next(n) -> {reads/copies n->buffer} -> RUN) | END(n)
   END(n) = nonce_free(n) -> (SKIP | MAIN(n, prefix'))

   After each nonce_next(n) call, a new name is available in n->buffer.
   This string needs to be copied by the client if it must be kept across
   calls. */
