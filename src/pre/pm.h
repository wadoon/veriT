   \brief Pre-processing for axiom schemata instantiation

   \note A <em>parametric sort</em> is defined by its name and its arity.  The
   arity is the number of sorts that need to be given as actual
   parameters to the sort, e.g. <tt>(List 1)</tt> and <tt>(Pair 2)</tt>.

   A parametric sort may have <em>ground instances</em>,
   e.g. <tt>(List Int)</tt> and <tt>(Pair Real Int)</tt> and
   <em>polymorphic instances</em>, e.g.  <tt>(List 's)</tt>,
   <tt>(Pair 's 't)</tt>, <tt>(Pair 's 's)</tt>.

   Polymorphic instances only occur within the scope of a quantifier.
   Such a quantification is called an <em>axiom schema</em> and is used to
   give a semantics to the sort (or, rather, to its instances).

   The reasoning engine of veriT is first-order and all sorts need to
   be ground. The goal of pm_process is to instantiate axiom schemata
   for all ground instances. Each axiom schema is substituted by
   the conjunction of those ground instances in the original formula.

   \remarks This pre-processing is not correct w.r.t incrementality
   \remarks This module only removes quantifiers in top level conjunction

/**
   \brief instantiates axioms with symbols on parametric sorts

   \param src a DAG

   \pre The following is expected of \c src \c

   - it is a conjunction

   - axiom schemata appear as arguments of the conjunction

   - axiom schemata are quantified formulas

   - the sort of the quantified variables is a sort variable or a
   parametric sort applied to a sort variable

   \return The DAG where all such axioms are replaced with a
   conjunction of universally quantified formulas. There is one
   such quantified formula for each possible combination of
   instantiation of a parametric sort in the original axiom.
   An instantiation of a parametric sort is the application of
   a sort substitution of polymorphic parametric sort occuring
   in the axiom with a non-polymorphic parametric sort occuring
   in DAG.

   If there is no such instance, the schemata are replaced
   by TRUE.
